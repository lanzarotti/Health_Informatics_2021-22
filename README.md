```Download Zip```. Than you can use your favourite file archiver ([7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), [WinZip](https://www.winzip.com/win/it/), [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) etc.) to unpack the files.

## Open/Execute files

The files are _Jupyter Notebooks_ that execute _Python_ code. To Open/Execute these files you will need an account Google to use the __Colaboratory ambient__ .

Alternatively (IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS COURSE!  ), you should install Python (with the required libraries) and Jupyter. The easiest way to do so is to install the __Anaconda Environment__.
